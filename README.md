# HCBL - Human Creative Burst Log

## About HCBL

The Human Creative Burst Log (HCBL) project aims to map, analyze, and visualize the spontaneous creative bursts that define human innovation. By logging bursts and identifying patterns of novelty and anomaly, HCBL forms the foundation for recursive memory fields and future dream architectures.

## What is a Burst?
A burst is a sudden, nonlinear expression of creativity, insight, or emotional resonance. In HCBL, each burst is treated as a unit of meaning.

## Why Detect Novelty and Anomalies?
- Novelty detection uncovers emerging creative directions.
- Anomaly detection identifies noise or signal drift.
